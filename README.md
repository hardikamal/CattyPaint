## Setting Up Your First Project - Step by Step
For a step-by-step guide how to deploy your first project, see: http://goo.gl/R0tmG

## ... Short Version
* First of all you need an Apple ID if you haven't got it by now create it. [Create Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyAppleId.woa/135/wa/createAppleId?wosid=4buecjiwQGa14dIxx55bYM&localang=de_DE)
* Now write a mail to your administrator of your Apple Developer Program. The Mail should look like this:

> Subject: [Catroid iOS Developer Team] Apple Development Certificates
> 
> Hi,
> 
> I am from the Catroid iOS-Team and would like to develop/test on my iDevice.
> Would you be so kind and send me an invitation.
> 
> Cheers,
>  Your Name

* Now you have to wait a bit until your administrator sends you an invitation through Apple.
* When you get the mail there is a link in it. Just click it and login with your Apple ID.
* Now continue with the following [guide](http://itunes.tugraz.at/media/items/ios_application_development_2011_pdf/1298971525-12_-_App_Deployment.pdf) from Josef Kolbitsch.
* Then write a mail to your administrator:

> I have uploaded my certificate and here is some additional data
> 


* Finished
